  ## Description
  This is my 12-Challenge. In this challenge I had to create the code from the ground up. I had to implement inquirer and postgres SQL. Had to create a database that the user can engage with to track employee information and edit it. I found this project to be a little time-consuming figuring out how to get everything from the prompts and queries to work together. I had to rely on async and await functions to get the right timing down. Also, I worked on trying to modularize my code as well. In the end I think I turned out to be a decent application.
